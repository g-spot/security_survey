Review: Survey of mobile network security in trending technologies
==================================================================

Summary
-------

The introduction does a good job at creating a context for the rest of the
paper by providing some general numbers for both NFC and bluetooth.
The remaining article is split in two where one author focuses on NFC where as
the other focuses on bluetooth.

The first part of the NFC section gives a competent introduction to NFC in
general. The other two parts explain the "Smart Poster Spoofing" and
"Eavesdropping" attacks respectively, including different countermeasures either
in hardware, software or a combination thereof. All presented countermeasures 
vary in overhead, complexity, effectiveness and the author does a good job at
pointing them out.

Same as in the NFC, the first part of the Bluetooth section gives an
introduction to the different versions and modes of the BT technology.
The remainder of the section presents different vulnerabilities and how they
can be attacked and prevented for the different Bluetooth versions / modes.
The section contains a good explanation of how "Secure Simple Pairing" works
and how it can be exploited using a man-in-the-middle attack.
The next part describes attacks and a risk-based testing approach used 
in automotive environments. The attacks include Surveillance, Obfuscation,
Sniffing, etc. and are each accompanied by a description and whether they were
successful.
The last part focuses on the Low Energy bluetooth mode, which was just recently
introduced.

Strengths
---------

* Clear and consistent general structure of the article.
* Good choices of vulnerabilities and countermeasures (especially the NFC
  section)
* Actuality of the presented content: oldest article is from 2009 (!)


Weaknesses
----------

* The structure of the bluetooth part is not as clear
* I would like to see one small paragraph about relevant security conferences
  or research groups in this field.
* Too many technical details in some cases. Sentences like "... of the NFC
  subcarrier using load-based modulation of the tuned coil.", need either more
  explanation or simplification. This is especially true for the bluetooth part
  where multiple tools and formulas are mentioned without explanation.
