   Paper: Survey of mobile network security in trending technologies, focusing on Near Field Communication and Bluetooth
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    ===== Paper summary =====

	This paper describes the two wirless technologies bluetooth and NFC. In detail it summarizes two attacks on NFC and three attacks on bluetooth.
	In fact they are describing already known threats and risks and give examples how they can be mitigated or prevented if possible.
	When you read this paper you will get a detailed description about current risks, but you won't find an outlook to upcoming threats and neither an outlook in future research concerning this technology.
	

	
                    ===== Paper strengths =====

	Each technology or attack technique is described very well and the used figures are useful.
	
	You used some citations in your paper (The other group what I have reviewed doesn't).
	
	You have used all your references in the paper at least once. 
	(May you can check if it is possible to search for the reference [4] in the pdf on your environment - At mine it doesn't find it)
	
	The paper is written good and has a clear structure. 
	You split it up into NFC and BT and followed the same approach to describe them in both sections (Description / What it is used for / Hacks&Countermeasures).

	Each section is enumerated and the whole document is divided into smaller parts. This shows that you know what you're talking about and how you can separate the topics.
	
	
	
                    ===== Paper weaknesses =====
					
[SOLVED by gertschi, removed technical terms]	You often use too many technical terms within a few sentences and this makes it really hard to read. (Just one Example is: 2.2.2 Countermeasures against Smart Poster Spoofing)

[TODO shorty]	Same for the section where you describe the bluetooth technologies. May you can enumerate them or insert a table which makes it easier to understand.
	
[TODO shorty at bluetooth sections]	May you can proofread your paper again and set some missing commas. You sometime have sentences going over 3 lines without a break.
	
[NO-PROBLEM no way this is wayyyyyy too much overhead]	Like mentioned above you have split up NFC and Bluetooth, but may there are some issues or details which are relevant for both.
	It would be nice if you can compare the attack vectors of both in a short paragraph.
